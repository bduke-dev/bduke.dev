      <p>Overview: Flash flooding is a very sudden, destructive natural disaster. Per the National
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in the United States the national 30-year
        average for flood deaths is 127 a year. This research is to make a cheap and effective
        wireless network of sensors based around the Arduino device to detect and provide real-time
        data about a particular steam or area. This will provide the potential to save lives and
        property by offering advanced warning to those in the affected area.</p>
    </div>
    <p>My Part: I have helped work on the hardware and code for the devices, however my primary focus
      for the project is data transmission, database design, and web app development. I have designed
      the way in which the data is stripped at the base station and inserted to the database. Now, I
      am currently working on developing the web application for both desktop and mobile use, using a
      responsive design to work on a variety of devices and screen sizes.</p>

    <h3 class="line">Soil Tunnel Trailer Website</h3>
    <h5>Status: Completed | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bmduke1997/WVSoilTrailer_Website">GitHub</a>
    </h5>
    <p>"The Soil Tunnel Trailer" site is a website for the WV Capitol Conservation District. I was
      approached by the coordinator through their son who was on my highschool robotics team. This
      website is used as a means for schools and the community to know where "The Soil Tunnel Trailer"
      will be and to get ahold of the coordinator to schedule a visit. </p>

      Geeks and Gadgets Website</h3>
    <h5>Status: Completed | <a target="_blank" href="http://mugeeksandgadgets.github.io">Live Link</a>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MUGeeksandGadgets/MUGeeksandGadgets.github.io">GitHub</a>
    </h5>
    <p>I started working on this site as a side project to help my friend Patrick, who is the president
      of the Geeks and Gadgets club at Marshall. He did not have time to maintain it or redo it. So, I
      took the task, and because of my work on this site I have taken a larger role in the group. I am
      now the Vice President and web developer for the group.</p>

    <h3 class="line">Putnam Area Robotics Team
      Website</h3>
    <h5>Status: Maintenance | <a target="_blank" href="http://parts3492.org">Live Link</a> <a target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/3492PARTs/PARTs_Website">GitHub</a></h5>
    <p>This is my first ever website! I developed it for my highschool robotics team, it started
      because
      I was tired of using "drag-n-drop" sites. I consider it my playground in the web development
      world, as I had no prior knowledge when writing it.</p>

    <h5>Status: Maintenance | <a href="cssslider/">Info/Demo</a>&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
        href="https://gitlab.com/bduke97/CSS_Slider">GitLab</a></h5>
    <p>While working on "The Soil Tunnel Trailer" website I noticed that the CSS Slider I used on my
      team's website was not licensed for commercial use. Thus, my decision to code my own. This
      slider can be viewed by clicking the link above, or on both the robotics team's and "Soil Tunnel
      Trailer" sites. The code is free to use and modify!</p>

    <h3 class="line">HTML Compiler</h3>
    <h5>Status: Development | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bmduke1997/HTML-Compiler">GitHub</a></h5>
    <p>A simple GUI interface coded in Java using the JavaFX library to aid in the update of Navigation
      and Footer elements on websites. It can be quite tedious to update a Nav or Footer on each page
      of a static website, so this tool can be used per its documentation on GitHub to update every
      HTML file.</p>

    <h5>Status: Completed | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bmduke1997/WeatherAndroidForecast">GitHub</a>
    </h5>
    <p>A weather app developed as a group project for my CS 481 - Android App Development class.</p>

    <h3 class="line">"Wahjudi Chess"</h3>
    <h5>Status: Completed | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bmduke1997/wahjudichess">GitHub</a></h5>
    <p>A play on suicide chess where the object of the game is to be the first loser, thus making you
      the winner! This variant of suicide chess is played on a smaller board and has a computer AI to
      play against. This game was developed as a group project for my CS 210 - Data Structures and
      Algorithms class.</p>

    <h3 class="line">"Maze Solver"</h3>
    <h5>Status: Completed | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bmduke1997/MazeSolver">GitHub</a></h5>
    <p>A GUI application developed to solve 3D mazes with portals, stairs, and the possibility for no,
      many, or unreachable exits! Sounds confusing? Well it is! However, you can load up any of the
      pre-included text files in the repo and watch the algorithm solve it using depth first
      search...it was my first time coming up with an algorithm to solve a problem, I was only a
      sophomore at the time! Anyway, this was the first project for my CS 210 - Data Structures and
      Algorithms class.</p>
